%description
XRMC is a Monte Carlo program for accurate simulation of X-ray imaging and spectroscopy experiments in heterogeneous samples. The use of the Monte Carlo method makes the code suitable for the detailed simulation of complex experiments on generic samples. Variance reduction techniques are used for reducing considerably the computation time compared to general purpose Monte Carlo programs. The program is written in c++ and has been tested on Linux, Mac OS X and MS Windows platforms.

Variance reduction techniques are used for reducing considerably the computation time compared to general purpose Monte Carlo programs. The program is written in c++ and has been tested on Linux, Mac OS X and MS Windows platforms.

This package contains the xrmc-xmimsim plug-in, giving the user access to the capabilities of the XMI-MSIM detector convolution functions.
